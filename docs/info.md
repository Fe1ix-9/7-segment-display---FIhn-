## How it works

With a sequence of 4 D-type flipflops and one more that controls the CLK, a logic gate circuit is created to later accommodate and to have more accessible to accommodate this circuit, the negated Q outputs are connected to not gates and more accommodating buffers for simplicity, from there the circuit is made that will follow a previously made truth table to show FIhn on the 7-segment display.

## How to test

To review it, you should have the dip switch OFF in this case due to how it is arranged. To activate the voltage input to the circuit, have the slide active to the left so that the CLK signal can pass through. If it does not catch, activate it with the push button.

## External hardware

The elements it contains are a screen as an output and what is connected to the input is a push button, a slide switch, with a clock generator and an LED connected on the other side, an 8-pin dip switch.
